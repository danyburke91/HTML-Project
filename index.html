                <h2>About myself</h2>
                <p>My name is Sara Daniela Burke, everybody calls me Dany. I was born on December 5<sup>th</sup>, 1991. Iâ€™m 30 years old and I was born and raised in Ecuador, 
                better known as The middle of the World. <br /> It is a beautiful country to grow up in. I grew up surrounded by mountains and nature. You can find the most 
                wonderful landscapings in the world, <br /> like Annie Dillard, a famous american author once said: <cite>The point of going somewhere in Ecuador is not to see the most spectacular anything. 
                It is simply to see what is there.</cite></p>

                <h2>My professional Background</h2> 
                <p>I studied Finance in college, and after I graduated I moved to the US. I have been living here for over 6 years, and I <b>love it.</b>
                    <br />Since I arrived here I have been working in different industries, but during COVID, I discover my passion for programming, <br />I started by creating an
                    e-commerce website with some templates, but I wanted to learn everything from scratch, in order to be a professional Web Developer. </p>

                    <h2>Why to become a Web a Developer?</h2>
                <p><img src="images/webdevelop.jpg" alt="Web development" align="left" />I want to become a web developer because I want to be able to create apps and websites that can contribute in a positive way to the world. 
                    <br />I think technology is now like a necessity, it allows people to learn, develop, and connect with other people around the world.
                    <ol>Reasons why studying web development is so valuable:
                        <li>The high demand</li>
                        <li>Work flexibility</li>
                        <li>Good compensation</li>
                        <li>Qualification</li>
                        <li>Sense of fulfillment</li>
                    </ol> 
                    <br />With this career I think I have the potential of helping and impacting not only locally but also globally in great ways. 
                    <stong>I want to create art and share it with the world.</stong>
